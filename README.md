# Phoble
Phoble works by querying Spotify's public API to generate the song of the day. Our algorithm is designed to display songs on a popularity gradient, which gives users a mix of familiar favorites and songs they may have never heard of. As the week goes on, the songs become less and less mainstream until the cycle resets on Monday. Our goal is to encourage genuine conversation about all of these songs, and to help introduce users to different tastes and perspectives.


Anyone can listen to snippets of every song directly on our website. The full versions of each song are only displayed to users who are logged into Spotify. Phoble is not directly affiliated with Spotify in any way.
