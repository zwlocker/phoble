import { Filter } from 'bad-words'
...
const filter = new Filter();

console.log(filter.clean("Don't be an ash0le")); //Don't be an ******

### Add words to the blacklist

```js
const filter = new Filter()

filter.addWords('some', 'bad', 'word')

filter.clean('some bad word!') //**** *** ****!

//or use an array using the spread operator

const newBadWords = ['some', 'bad', 'word']

filter.addWords(...newBadWords)

filter.clean('some bad word!') //**** *** ****!
